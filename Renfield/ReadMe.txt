This Python script leverages OpenAI's natural language model to automate security footprinting and identify potential attack vectors. 
It gathers information on specified entities (e.g., domain names, personnel) from online sources, analyzes the data, assigns risk scores, 
and generates a comprehensive security risk assessment report. Use this tool to enhance your organization's cybersecurity measures by 
proactively identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
