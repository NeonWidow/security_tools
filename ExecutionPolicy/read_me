SetExecutionPolicy.bat

Description:

This Batch script facilitates the modification of the PowerShell Execution Policy, a security feature that determines the conditions under which PowerShell scripts can be run. The script is designed to be executed in situations where the current Execution Policy restricts the running of PowerShell scripts, providing a convenient way to adjust the policy without requiring changes to the system-wide policy.

Usage:

    Run as Administrator: Ensure that the script is executed with administrative privileges (Run as Administrator).

    Execution Policy Modification: The script utilizes the PowerShell.exe executable to run a one-liner PowerShell command. It sets the Execution Policy for the current user to RemoteSigned without needing to change the system-wide Execution Policy.
